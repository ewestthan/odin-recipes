        Crab, and its old friends, the Holy Trinity, are a classic combo, and so it was no surprise they worked so well in an Asian-style rice noodle dish – an experiment gone right. Garnish with sliced green onion.

    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk garlic, ketchup, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, hot sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and cumin together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl; cover with boiling water and stir with tongs. Let soak for 10 minutes.        </li>
        <li>While noodles soak, heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir celery, jalapenos, and green onions until tender and fragrant, about 10 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Drain noodles and place in the pan; add the sauce and crabmeat. Cook and stir until noodles are coated evenly and everything is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
